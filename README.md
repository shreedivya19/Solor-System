# 🌍 Random Planet Surface Area Calculator

This is a fun and educational Python program that randomly selects a planet and calculates its surface area using the formula for the surface area of a sphere:
**A = 4 × π × r²**

## 🪐 Planets Included

* Mercury
* Venus
* Earth
* Mars
* Saturn

## 📦 What It Does

* Randomly picks one of the listed planets
* Determines its radius in kilometers
* Calculates the planet's surface area
* Displays both the planet name and its surface area

## 🧮 Formula Used

```
Surface Area = 4 × π × radius²
```

## 🔧 Requirements

* Python 3.x
* `math` module (built-in)
* `random` module (built-in)

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository or copy the code into a file named `planet_area.py`.
3. Run the program:

   ```bash
   python3 planet_area.py
   ```

## 💡 Example Output

```
Random Planet: Mars
Area of random_planet: 144371391.98166823
```

## 🛠️ Future Improvements

* Add more planets (e.g., Jupiter, Uranus, Neptune)
* Include units (km²) in output
* Visual representation using `matplotlib`
